I have been thinking about starting a blog for a while, so I am finally writing my first post.  I recently attended the alt.net open spaces in Seattle, and some conversations I had there made me decide to start a blog.

A little background;   I have been a computer geek since I was a kid, but I never did any amount of programming until I started college in 2003.  I have been working as an ASP.NET developer since January 2006, and I graduated from school in the beginning of 2007.

I'm not sure what the goal of this blog is yet, for the time being I am going to post problems I run into ( and hopefully resolve:-) ).  Hopefully other people will get some benefit from it as well, but if nothing else, it will be a good reference for me.</div>
