<p>Here are some notes from my experience building a SharePoint state machine workflow.</p><ul><li>All fields delcared on the workflow object must be serializable type or marked nonSerializedAny activities before the workflow activated event will not have access to workflow properties </li>
<li>Remember to remove dll's from the GAC when building, GAC'ed versions will supersede local versions </li>
<li>Emailing from SharePoint requires the network service account to have local activation permission for "IIS WAMREG Admin Service" (a dcom service): <a href="http://www.cleverworkarounds.com/2007/10/25/dcom-fun-with-sharepoint/">http://www.cleverworkarounds.com/2007/10/25/dcom-fun-with-sharepoint/</a> </li>
<li>There is a bug in the delay activity, here are some patches: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2008/07/15/announcing-availability-of-infrastructure-updates.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2008/07/15/announcing-availability-of-infrastructure-updates.aspx</a>, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953630/">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953630/</a> </li>
<li>SetSate is not like a return, the rest of the activities in that phase will still execute </li>
<li>You cannot have more than one list template in a feature </li>
<li>Set workflow logging level use this command:
<ul>
<li>stsadm -o setlogginglevel -category "Workflow Infrastructure" -tracelevel verbose </li></ul></li>
<li>To get and set timer settings use this command:
<ul>
<li>stsadm -o getproperty -pn job-workflow -url <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a> </li>
<li>stsadm -o setproperty -pn job-workflow -pv "Every 1 minutes between 0 and 59" -url <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a> </li></ul></li>
<li>To allow unsigned powershell scripts to run use this command:
</li><ul><li>Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
</li></ul></ul><h4>Workflow Versioning
</h4><ul><li>There is no concept of versioning for Visual Studio created SharePoint workflows </li>
<li>Instead, include the version in the feature path, name, description and workflow name and description </li>
<li>Change the assembly version, and the version in each of the other places </li>
<li>Deploy as a new feature </li>
<li>Make sure the old workflow is marked "No new instances" after you associate the new version (this should be automatic) </li>
<li>Based on this, it seems like workflows should be in their own features to allow for simpler versioning </li>
<li>Delay activities were not working correctly </li>
<li>Worked with MS Premier support for weeks to try and resolve this </li>
<li>Resetting the SharePoint timer service made the delay activity work correctly </li>
<li>When they are initialized in the designer, setting the value to something else in the initialize event does not work </li>
<li>If you bind the timeout property to a dependency field then it can be set in the initialize timeout handler, much like SendEmailActivity properties </li></ul></div>
